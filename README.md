# Benchmark my ass
Benchmark with docker

## Inspiration
I really hate nodejs fanboys, a lot of them are too dumb or noob to see behind the hype.
And most of them never actually run any benchmark!

I am doing them a favour :innocent:

## Check nothing up my sleeves
Take a look at the

- [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml)
- [index.go](index.go)
- [index.js](index.js)
- [index.php](index.php)

## Running the benchmark
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SamAsEnd/bench-my-ass.git
cd bench-my-ass

docker-compose up
```

## Contributing
You know what to do ...
